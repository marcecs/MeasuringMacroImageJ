# MeasuringMacroImageJ
Macro to include Solidity and Convexity on a stack of images. It only takes into account the largest mask per slice in the task to take the measurements.


This code is adapted from https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/macros/ConvexitySolidarity.txt to allow to iterate through a stack of images.
